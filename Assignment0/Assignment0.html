        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new
                home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among
                us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
                <br>
                We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority
                than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be
                naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do
                you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.
                <br>
                Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor
                received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world.
                <span id="p1">
                    Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a
                    public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our
                    collective actions.
                </span>
                <span class="point-marker"><a href="#detail-contents"><sup>1</sup></a></span>
                <br>
                You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our
                marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our
                society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions. You claim there are problems among us
                that you need to solve.
                <span id="p2">
                    You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there
                    are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are
                    forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world,
                    not yours. Our world is different.
                </span>
                <span class="point-marker"><a href="#detail-contents"><sup>2</sup></a></span>
                <br>
                Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the
                web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies
                live.
                <br>
                We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power,
                military force, or station of birth.
                <br>
                <span id="p3">
                    We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular,
                    without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
                </span>
                <span class="point-marker"><a href="#detail-contents"><sup>3</sup></a></span>
                <br>
                Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are
                all based on matter, and there is no matter here.
                <br>
                Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that
                from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may
                be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would
                generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that
                basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
                <br>
                In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your
                own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis.
                These dreams must now be born anew in us.
                <br>
                You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be
                immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are
                too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the
                debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate
                the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
                <br>
                In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the
                virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion
                for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.
                <br>
                Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America
                and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be
                another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create
                can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
                your factories to accomplish.
                <br>
                These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of
                freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must
                declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our
                bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
                <br>
                We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your
                governments have made before.

                                depending on where the website is hosted, it needs to follow the law.</a></li>

                                There are a lot more standards and laws in place that enforce online safety. Some have
                                negative outcomes, and some have positive outcomes. I am also not sure if there is a
                                universal social contract that applies throughout the whole internet. It feels like
                                individual websites have their own environment, and there are certain websites the the
                                government has more power over.</a></li>

                                For better or for worse, this part of the internet holds a lot of power. We've seen this
                                used in a positive and negative way. It can be used to raise funds to grow more trees, but
                                can be also to spread vaccine information. As Jenny Odell said in her article, How to
                                Internet: "people use the internet to find what they want. A queer teenager feeling isolated
                                in the Midwest can use it to find solace and community. But a bigot can also use it to find
                                all the 'research' and 'facts' he needs to bolster an opinion that was never going to be
                                changed anyway."
