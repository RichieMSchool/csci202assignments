        When I was 10, I wanted to learn how to play the guitar, so my parents bought me one and enrolled me into a class. <br>
        My teacher taught the basics and told me to play a lot of classical songs. <br>
        I burned myself out after a couple years and stopped completely <br>
        I didn't touch my guitar for 4 years <br>

        <b>4 years later</b>, I went to community college through running start. <br>
        I enrolled into an audio engineering course and learned a lot about digital music. <br>
        I enjoyed it so much, that I started learning about DAWs in my own time. <br>
        I even played my guitar again. <br>
        but it still didn't go anywhere.
        <br><br>

        <b>One quarter later,</b> I enrolled in my very first computer science class. <br>
        After learning the fundamentals, I wrote my first program and I loved the process. <br>
        I stuck with it and continued taking CS classes each quarter. <br>
        I finally knew what I wanted to do. <br>

        <b>Then, the pandemic hit.</b><br>
        Everything was suddenly moved online, and there wasn't much to do outside of classes.<br>
        So, I tried something new: 3D-Modelling. <br>
        I started with a low-poly island <br>

        Then, I was <a href="a1-7.html#scroll">introduced to game development</a>
