        When I was 10, I wanted to learn how to play the guitar, so my parents bought me one and enrolled me into a class. <br>
        My teacher taught the basics and told me to play a lot of classical songs. <br>
        I burned myself out after a couple years and stopped completely <br>
        I didn't touch my guitar for 4 years <br>

        <br><br>
        <b>4 years later</b>, I went to community college through running start. <br>
        I enrolled into an audio engineering course and learned a lot about digital music. <br>
        I enjoyed it so much, that I started learning about DAWs in my own time. <br>
        I even played my guitar again. <br>
        but it still didn't go anywhere.
        <br><br>

        <b>One quarter later,</b> I enrolled in my very first computer science class. <br>
        After learning the fundamentals, I wrote my first program and I loved the process. <br>
        I stuck with it and continued taking CS classes each quarter. <br>
        I finally knew what I wanted to do. <br>

        <br><br>

        <b>Then, the pandemic hit.</b><br>
        Everything was suddenly moved online, and there wasn't much to do outside of classes.<br>
        So, I tried something new: 3D-Modelling. <br>
        I started with a low-poly island <br>

        <br>

        And went from there <br>

        <br>
        <b>Then, I was introduced to game development</b> <br>
        I downloaded a game engine called unity, and started messing around.
        I made a simple demo to understand how it works <br>
        Then, I realized I can combine all of my hobbies.</a>

        <br><br>
        <span id="scroll"></span>
        <b>I could combine 3D-Modelling, music, and programming all into one project!</b> <br>
        I participated in game jams on <a href="https://itch.io/jams" target="_blank">itch.io</a> <br>
        <br>
        The games weren't great, but I liked making them<br>
        I don't plan on releasing a full game, or pursuing game-dev as a career. <br>
        But I have a good reason to do each of my hobbies to achieve a single goal. <br>
        And I get to see all of these elements complement each other.
